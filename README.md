# Getting Started

To clone the repository first make sure you have added your ssh public key to your github profile and then run:

### `git clone --shared git@github.com:iperkins987/cs422_project01.git`

## Setting up Flask

Next we want to create a python virutal enviroment in the backend. Make sure you are in the backend directory and then run:

### Windows: `python -m venv venv`
### Mac or Linux: `python3 -m venv venv`

We then need to activate the virutal enviroment:

### Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
### Mac or Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

Then install Flask:

### Windows: `pip install flask`
### Mac or Linux: `pip3 install flask`

## Setting up React

Move into frontend and run:

### `npm install`

## How to Run:

First start the backend, so you must start activate the virtual enviroment and then run:

### Windows: `python backend.py`
### Mac or Linux: `python3 backend.py`

Then move to the frontend folder and run:

### `npm start`
